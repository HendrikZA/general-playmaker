Quick Message:

Thanks for checking out my custom actions for Oculus Go and Gear VR :)

These actions are versatile and can allow many possibilities of control for your Oculus Go and Samsung Gear VR projects. I will be adding more actions to this list as needs arise, please keep checking the forum post for updates.

Please reach me on the Playmaker forums (HendrikB) if you have any suggestions or need help with these actions.

Usage:
------

The custom actions will show in the "Input" category in your Playmaker actions list.
These steps below will work for installing / using any of my Playmaker Oculus Go actions:

1. Install Playmaker (of course!)
2. Download and import the Oculus Unity Utilities package available here: https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-utilities-for-unity-5/ into your Unity project.
3. Add the OVRManager.cs script into any empty GameObject in your scene (you need OVRManager.cs in your scene to use these actions). The OVRManager.cs script is included in the Oculus Utilities package in Step 2 above.
4. Download my action and add it to your project's assets folder, or a sub-folder in your assets folder, anywhere you want.
 4.1. If you're new to Github, the best way to get the actual code for the script is to click on the script name on the Github page, then when the page loads, click on the RAW button to get the actual code pre-formatted on the page. Right-click anywhere on that page, and select "Save as", and save the script to your computer. Then simply drag it into your Unity project.
 4.2. Alternatively you can download all my actions in a Zip file by going to the root of my Github repo (https://github.com/HendrikZA/general-playmaker), and then just click on the "Clone or download" button, and select to download ZIP. Then just drag them into your project.
5. You're all set. You can find the newly added action/s in your Input category in the Action Browser. Just add the action to an FSM and use as you want.

Quick Note on "OculusGoButtonDown.cs":
-------------------------------------
OculusGoButtonDown.cs was the first script I wrote for Oculus Go and Gear VR, and contains many things in one action. However, I decided to split off each section of that action into smaller actions. I'd recommend using the smaller actions for your needs, but if you prefer one large one action then go ahead and use OculusGoButtonDown.cs :)
