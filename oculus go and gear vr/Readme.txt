Thanks for checking out my custom action for Oculus Go and Gear VR :)

This action is versatile and can allow many possibilities of control for your projects. I will be adding more features soon, please keep checking the forum post for updates.

Please reach me on the Playmaker forums (HendrikB) if you have any suggestions or help with these actions.

Usage:
------

The custom action will show in the "Input" category in your Playmaker actions list.
The only thing you need to use it is:

1. Install Playmaker (of course!)
2. Download and import the Oculus Unity Utilities package available here: https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-utilities-for-unity-5/ into your Unity project.
3. Add the OVRManager.cs script into any empty GameObject in your scene (you need OVRManager.cs in your scene to use these actions). The OVRManager.cs script is included in the Oculus Utilities package in Step 2 above.
4. Download my action and add it to your project's assets folder, or a sub-folder in your assets folder, anywhere you want.
 4.1. If you're new to Github, the best way to get the actual code for the script is to click on the script name on the Github page, then when the page loads, click on the RAW button to get the code. Right-click anywhere on that page, and select "Save as", and save the script to your computer. Then simply drag it into your Unity project.
5. You're all set. You can find the action GetVRButtonDown in the Input category in the Action Browser. Just add the action to an FSM and use as you want.
