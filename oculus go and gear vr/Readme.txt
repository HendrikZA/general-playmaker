Thanks for checking out my custom actions for Oculus Go and Gear VR :)

I've just started writing Playmaker actions for the first time so hope to improve as I go along.

I'll add more custom actions for Oculus Go and Gear VR and also for general things in near future.

Please reach me on the Playmaker forums (HendrikB) if you have any suggestions or help with these actions.

Usage:
------

The custom actions will show in the "Custom" category in your Playmaker actions list.
The only thing you need to use them is:

1. Playmaker (of course!)
2. Download and import the Oculus Unity Utilities package available here: https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-utilities-for-unity-5/ into your Unity project.
3. Add the OVRManager.cs script into any empty GameObject in your scene (you need OVRManager in your scene to use these actions).
4. Download my actions and add them to your project's assets folder, or a sub-folder in your assets folder.
 4.1. If you're new to Github, the best way to get the actual code for the script is to click on the script name on the Guthub page, then when the page loads, click on the RAW button to get the code. Copy all the code on that page. Make a new C# script in Unity, name it to the exact same name of the script on my Github, e.g. GetVRButtonDown.cs, and then paste the code into it, and Save.
5. You're all set. Just add the actions to an FSM and use as you want.
